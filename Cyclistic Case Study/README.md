# Cyclistic Case Study
I am a junior data analyst working with the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. This case study follows the 6 steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.
# Business Task
This analysis will examine the business task: By using historical bike trip data, What trends can be uncovered and can help the Marketing team launch an effective campaign that will convert casual riders to Cyclistic annual members?

The team has come up with 3 main questions that can help achieve this goal.

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3. How Can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Findings
### KPIs & Metrics

Among the bikes used, Annual Members utilized them more than Casual Customers.

Casual customers showed a preference for electric bikes the most, with 53% favoring them, followed closely by the classic bike. However, the docked bike saw low usage at only 8%.

Annual members had an equal distribution between the classic bike (51%) and electric bike (49%), but the docked bike was not used at all.

Peak times tended to occur later in the day, and Casual customers rode more frequently than annual members.

Throughout the week, rides were consistent, except for Thursday and Saturday, when casual customers tended to ride more often than annual members.

As the summer months approached, the number of bike rides increased dramatically. Casual customers significantly outpaced annual members in the total rides throughout the year.
# Recommendations
1. Establish partnerships with social media influencers to create collaborative content promoting Cyclistic and highlighting the advantages of using the bikes. By enlisting influencers as brand ambassadors, they can offer exclusive sign-up discounts through their dedicated codes shared in their social media posts.

2. Given the significant increase in ride numbers during the summer months for all riders, it is recommended to implement a targeted promotion for annual membership sign-ups ahead of the summer season. This strategy aims to specifically engage casual customers and encourage their conversion into annual members.

3. Conduct comprehensive research to investigate the low utilization of docked bikes among both single-day use customers and annual members. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the underutilization and identify potential strategies for improving the usage of docked bikes among these customer segments.
