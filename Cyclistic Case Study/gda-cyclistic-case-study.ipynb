The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. This case study follows the 6 steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About the Company\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. \n\nCyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to\ncommute to work each day.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

By enlisting influencers as brand ambassadors, they can offer exclusive sign-up discounts through their dedicated codes shared in their social media posts.\n\n2. Given the significant increase in ride numbers during the summer months for all riders, it is recommended to implement a targeted promotion for annual membership sign-ups ahead of the summer season. This strategy aims to specifically engage casual customers and encourage their conversion into annual members.\n\n3. Conduct comprehensive research to investigate the low utilization of docked bikes among both single-day use customers and annual members.
