# Bellabeat Case Study
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I am tasked to work on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. In this case study, I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
# Business Task
Through an in-depth analysis of Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, Bellabeat aims to extract valuable insights regarding the usage patterns of smart devices. By leveraging this information, Bellabeat intends to enhance its understanding of customer preferences, optimize its product and service offerings, devise targeted marketing campaigns, and leverage emerging trends to drive consistent business growth.

This data analysis project aims to address three key questions:

1. What are the notable trends observed in the usage of smart devices?

2. How can these trends be applied to Bellabeat's customer base?

3. In what ways can these trends influence and shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

# About the Dataset
The data source used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle where it was uploaded by Möbius.

This particular dataset was compiled through a distributed survey conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. It includes data provided by 33 Fitbit users who voluntarily participated in the survey and consented to sharing their personal tracker data. The dataset encompasses minute-level information on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

Furthermore, the variation observed in the dataset output can be attributed to the usage of diverse Fitbit tracker models as well as individual differences in tracking behaviors and preferences.
# Findings
1. Obtaining significant insights without introducing potential biases is challenging due to the limited sample size of 33 participants and the lack of information regarding their genders and diverse backgrounds, thus highlighting the absence of diverse demographic information.

2. Based on the analysis conducted using the available data, a notable 93.5% were 'Active Users' meaning that they utilized their FitBit device consistently throughout the 31-day period.

3. The analysis of the users' average activity time revealed that 27 out of the 33 participants successfully achieved the recommended weekly activity of 150 minutes, as suggested by the CDC.

4. Based on research studies, including guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is recommended to achieve a daily step count of 10,000 for optimal health. However, in our analysis, the average user falls short of this minimum goal, with only 7 out of the 33 participants managing to reach it.

5. However, Saturday stood out with the highest average steps, followed by the early weekdays (Monday and Tuesday). This pattern indicates a potential trend where users strive to be more active immediately after the weekend, as evidenced by lower step counts on Sunday and moderately lower counts on Friday. Moreover, Saturday presents ample opportunities for increased physical activity and movement.

6. According to the analysis of participants' sleep patterns, individuals who averaged at least 5 hours of sleep tended to burn more calories during the day.
# Recommendations
### Improve Data Collection

Increase User Sample Size: To gain stronger actionable insights, Bellabeat must conduct an analysis using a larger, randomized sample size, with specific gender information. The provided sample size does not provide enough information to improve products/services, or make informed decisions. Increase # of User Inputs: Simplify the user information input process (such as weight, height, age, BMI, etc.) to strengthen the data points used in this analysis. This improved user experience would encourage more users to provide more information, highlighting the value it brings in personalized offerings.

### Improve Daily User Experience

Improve Daily Experience: Implement daily reminders within the app or Hardware to encourage users to maintain a healthy charge level, the reminder will help ensure that users have consistent device functionality and engagement. Sending daily notifications to users would prompt them to "Take a Walk" or "Get Ready for Bed," especially on days where users have no activity. This would support the development of healthy routines and foster positive lifestyle changes. These reminders can assist users in establishing consistent schedules and adopting healthier habits. Create Goal Recognition: Incorporate personal goals that reward badges, providing incentives for users to maintain consistent schedules and engage with the app regularly. These badges can serve as a form of recognition and motivation, encouraging users to stay committed to their health and wellness journey.

By implementing these recommendations, Bellabeat can enhance user engagement, facilitate healthy lifestyle changes, and provide a more personalized and rewarding experience for their users.
