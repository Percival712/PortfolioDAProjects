# Covid-19 Data Exploration Project
This project explores COVID-19 data, specifically information on deaths and vaccinations over the course of January 2020 to July 2023. It involves performing a range of SQL queries, from basic to advanced, to identify patterns and trends throughout the COVID-19 timeline. Once the data exploration is concluded in SQL, these queries are utilized to generate data visualizations using Tableau. **View my Visualizations** [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/giankarlo.alvarado/viz/Covid-19ProjectVizualizations/Dashboard1)

# Task
The objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data from 2020 to 2023 using SQL queries. I focused on exploring insights specific to the United States. Additionally, I also delved into global and regional data during the exploration.

# About the Data
This dataset is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

In order to draw stronger recommendations, **more data is required.** This would include gathering data for revenue and occupancy rates of each listing.

However, with the data collected, the “City of London” neighborhood could be a suitable area for someone to list new properties since there is an underwhelming amount of listings in comparison to the neighboring city of Westminster. Furthermore, the median listing price has a difference of only 10 per night between the two cities which in return could mean the City of London has an area of opportunity for profit.
