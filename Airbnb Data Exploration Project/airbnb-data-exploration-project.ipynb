The goal of this project was to discover insights about the different neighborhood listings from Hosts in the City of London. \nAsk Phase \nObjective\nWhat can we learn about the different hosts and areas in London?\nUnderstanding the different types of units listed. \nIdentify key insights on the neighborhoods in London that can be suitable ideas for the company. **Tableau visuals can be viewed** [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/giankarlo.alvarado/viz/AirbnbCityofLondon/AirbnbdetailsofLondon#2)\n## 1. Ask Phase\n\n#### Data Exploration Business Task\nGuiding Questions: \n\n1. What can we learn from predictions? (ex. Locations, prices,reviews etc.)  \n2. Is there any noticeable difference among the areas and what could be the reason for it?\n3. Which hosts are the busiest and why?\n4. What can the different types of units available tell us? \n\n## 2. Prepare Phase\n\nData collection: The Datasets provided are from Airbnb data. \n\nDatasets will be focused specifically on the city of London\nSources:\nAirbnb Data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/london-uk-airbnb-open-data\n\n## 3. Process Phase\n\n**Key Objectives: Data cleaning and manipulation with the datasets used in this case study.**\n\nTools that will be used in this case study are:\n*  SQL on BigQuery for data wrangling and manipulation of the data, as well as any cleaning procedures. \n* Data Visualization will be used on Tableau. \n* Google Slides to present actionable insights to stakeholders. \n \n**Data Cleaning and Manipulation Deliverables: Using Sheets** \n\nRemoved unwanted columns from the dataset.\n\n* “Neighborhood group” (empty cells) already have a neighborhood column\n* “license” (empty cells)\n* Removed “name” column (names of each individual home for rent) \n* Removed “ID” column (we already have host_id as a column with distinct values\n* Removed “last review date” column  \n\n1. Filtered and removed for any missing values that contain empty cells for “Host” column\n2. Trimmed whitespaces for all columns. (only “host” column needed to be adjusted)\n3.
