# Airbnb Data Exploration Project
This project analyzes Airbnb host listings data using SQL and visualizations created in Tableau. The goal of this project was to discover insights about the different neighborhood listings from Hosts in the City of London. Ask Phase Objective What can we learn about the different hosts and areas in London? Understanding the different types of units listed. Identify key insights on the neighborhoods in London that can be suitable ideas for the company.**Tableau visuals can be viewed** [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/giankarlo.alvarado/viz/AirbnbCityofLondon/AirbnbdetailsofLondon#2)

# Business Task
Guiding Questions:

What can we learn from predictions? (ex. Locations, prices,reviews etc.)
Is there any noticeable difference among the areas and what could be the reason for it?
Which hosts are the busiest and why?
What can the different types of units available tell us?

# Findings
#### KPIs & Metrics
- Westminster has the highest count of total listings at 82,350. Although a more popular destination, The City of London only has 2,562 listings.
- Westminster has the most hosts registered at 4,276, the most out of all the neighborhoods.
- The majority of hosts (24,681) have entire homes and/or apartments listed in London. Private rooms are made up of 19,993 hosts, with only 228 hosts listing hotels.
- As you move closer to the center of London, the number of hosts generally increases. Only 215 registered hosts have listings in that area. Westminster has the highest number of listings, followed by Hackney and Tower Hamlets.
- After reviewing the max and average prices in all neighborhoods, some listings were found to have a max price of 25,000 a night; whereas 31 of the 34 neighborhoods listed their properties at under 100 a night. Due to various price levels, the average price per listing was inconclusive..
- The median price had a stronger representation of how much the actual prices were.
- Hackney had the lowest availability listed out of all neighborhoods, with only 33 listings.
- Westminster also has the median price of 140 a night, whereas the city of london has the median price listed at 150 a night.
# Conclusion
In order to draw stronger recommendations, **more data is required.** This would include gathering data for revenue and occupancy rates of each listing.

However, with the data collected, the “City of London” neighborhood could be a suitable area for someone to list new properties since there is an underwhelming amount of listings in comparison to the neighboring city of Westminster. Furthermore, the median listing price has a difference of only 10 per night between the two cities which in return could mean the City of London has an area of opportunity for profit.
